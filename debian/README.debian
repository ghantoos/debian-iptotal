Using iptotal with Apache2:
---------------------------
An apache configuration file template is shipped with this package. In order to
use it, it should be symlinked inside apache2's configuration folder:
  $ sudo ln -s /etc/iptotal/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/
Then reload apache2 configuration:
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Note concerning iptotal's data directory:
-----------------------------------------
Some important changes have been applied to iptotal's data directory over the
last releases:
* Upgrading from a version lower than 0.3.3-8:
  In this version, the data directory is set to /var/www/iptotal. As the
  /var/www direcotry is not stated in the FHS to be a standard directory, the
  iptotal data was moved to /var/lib/iptotal and /usr/share/iptotal/www.
  As a result, when upgrading from 0.3.3-8 (or an older release) to the current
  release of iptotal:
   - generated files from your older installation are moved from
     /var/www/iptotal to /var/lib/iptotal.
   - static files that are shipped within this package are moved to
     /usr/share/iptotal/www.

* Upgrading from 0.3.3-10:
  When upgrading from this version to the current release:
   - generated files from your older installation are moved from
     /usr/lib/iptotal to /var/lib/iptotal.
