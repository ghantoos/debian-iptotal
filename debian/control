Description: monitor for IP traffic, not requiring SNMP
 iptotal is yet another IP traffic monitor. It listens to a network interface in
 non-promiscuous mode, and measures IP bandwidth usage. After the specified
 number of seconds, the average throughput is printed at total, input and output
 usage.
 .
 The utility can be used to measure bandwidth usage without the need for an SNMP
 daemon.  In combination with a simple script and rrdtool it can be used to
 present the measured data in graphical format e.g. through a web interface.
 The package contains www + CGI sample files.
