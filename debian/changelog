iptotal (0.3.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. (Closes: #473843)
  * debian/rules:
    - Moved the copying of /usr/share/misc/config.{sub,guess} from the clean
      section to the configure section. And added functions to backup/restore
      the config{sud,guess} files provided by upstream.
    - Changed the data directory from /var/www/iptotal to 
      /usr/lib/iptotal/ (user content) and /usr/share/iptotal/www (static).
      (Closes: #553536)
    - Moved configuration file from /etc/ to /etc/iptotal/ directory.
    - Added dh_lintian in the binary-arch section to install the override file.
  * debian/control:
    - Added build dependency on autotools-dev.
  * debian/patches:
    - Added 05_fix_old_fixes.dpatch: Includes all changes made by original
      maintainer outside the debian/ directory.
    - Updated the 00list placing 05_fix_old_fixes.dpatch before 
      04_fix_kbytes_sufixes.dpatch.
  * debian/init:
    - Renamed debian/init.d to debian/init.
    - Added a short description.
    - Forced deletion of the pid file as daemon does not take care of this.
    - Added support for /etc/default/iptotal
    - Added force-start option, to start the daemon, ignoring the content of 
      the /etc/default/iptotal file.
  * debian/postinst:
    - Reloads apache2 configuration.
    - As installation path has changed in this release, added a temporary
      copying of old files to the new working directory, to prevent data
      history loss.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Updated copyright file format.
  * Added apache configuration file (i.e. debian/apache.conf).
  * Added debian/dirs to create both cgi and working directories.
  * Added debian/links to link the static content to the working directory
    (i.e. /usr/lib/iptotal).
  * Added debian/install file in order to clean up the debian/rules file.
  * Added debian/postrm file to reload apache2 configuration after purging
    or removing the iptotal package.
  * Added debian/default file, in order to easily disable iptotald.
    (Closes: #317260)
  * Moved iptotal.8 man page to the debian/ directory as it isn't provided
    by upstream.
  * Added a lintian override of package-contains-empty-directory, as the
    /usr/lib/iptotal/archive/ directory is intentionally created empty during
    the initial installation.
